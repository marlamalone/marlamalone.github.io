## hey it's marla, who dis?

The top 3 coolest things about me, according to me.
1. I *love* dogs. I am a doggo fanatic. It is excessive, but it really just means I'm passionate.

2. I can lucid dream. This is a newfound discovery of mine even though I guess I've been doing it all my life.


3. All of the bones in my body are empathy bones. I **feel** things, but in a good way.
In a healthy, balanced way. I just care a lot about others.
